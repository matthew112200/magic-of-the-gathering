  <center><h1>rules to play magic the gathering?</h1></center>
  <h3>mana system</h3>
  <p>The Magic: The Gathering game is a strategy game played by two or more players, each of whom has a customized deck of Magic cards.
Over the course of the game, each player will take turns playing cards such as lands (which enable you to play your other cards), creatures,
sorceries, and other spells. Each player starts at 20 life. When you reduce your opponent to 0 life by attacking with creatures and playing
spells, you win!</p>
<h3>Five Colors of Mana</h3>
<p>Only one thing unites the infinite planes of the Multiverse: mana, the energy that fuels all magic. The five colors of mana are imbued
in the land itself, and a Planeswalker with a connection to a place can call upon its mana from across the sea of Æther between worlds.
Each color of mana fuels a different kind of powerful magic for you to command. For example, red spells have oR in their costs,
and tapping (turning) a Mountain gives you oR that you can spend to cast spells. It’s up to you whether to master one color or all five</p>
<h3>white</h3>
<p>
White is the color of law, order, and
structure. The sprawling Plains,
populated by soldiers, clerics, and
angels, provide white mana. You send
coordinated armies of smaller creatures
into battle to teach the enemy a lesson.</p>
<h3>green</h3>
<p>
Green magic is about growth, life, and
brute force. The Forests overflow with
green mana, which represents the pulse
of nature. You empower your creatures
with the predatory might of nature and
dominate through sheer size.</p>
<h3>red</h3>
<p>
Red magic erupts with fire, frenzy, and
storms of rock and lava. Red mana comes
from Mountains and volcanoes. You
act quickly and recklessly, channeling
your wild emotions to summon mighty
dragons or crush the ground your
enemies walk on.</p>
<h3>Blue</h3>
<p>
Blue magic relies on trickery and
manipulation. Islands provide blue
mana, the color of the deep sea and
the endless sky. You work behind the
scenes, controlling your environment
completely before making a move.</p>
<h3>Black</h3>
<p>

Black magic is about death, disease, and
power at any cost. Black mana comes
from dank Swamps, where things fester
and rot. You are as selfish and twisted as
the undead creatures and unspeakable
horrors you command.</p>

<center><h1>the types of cards</h1></center>
<h3>instant</h3>
<p>
An instant is just like a sorcery, except you can cast it just about any time you want, even during your
opponent’s turn or in response to another spell. Like a sorcery, an instant has its effect, then you put it into
your graveyard.</p>
<h3>enchantment</h3>
<p>An enchantment represents a stable magical manifestation. An enchantment is a permanent. This means two
things: you can cast one only at the time you could cast a sorcery, and after you cast one, you’ll put it on the
table in front of you, near your lands. (Most players keep their lands closer to them, then put their other
cards closer to the middle of the table.) The card is now on the battlefield. A card on the battlefield is called a
permanent because it sticks around permanently (well, unless something destroys it).
Some enchantments are Auras. An Aura enters the battlefield attached to a permanent and affects that
permanent while it’s on the battlefield. If the enchanted permanent leaves the battlefield, the Aura is put
into its owner’s graveyard.
<h3>Artifact</h3>
An artifact represents a magical relic. Like an enchantment, an artifact is a permanent, so it’ll stay on the
battlefield affecting the game. Most artifacts are colorless, so you can cast one no matter what kinds of lands
you have.
Some artifacts are Equipment. You can pay to attach an Equipment to a creature you control to make that
creature more powerful. If an equipped creature leaves the battlefield, the Equipment doesn’t—the creature
drops it and it remains on the battlefield.
<h3>Creature</h3>
Creatures fight for you. They’re permanents, but unlike any other kind of permanent, creatures can attack
and block. Each creature has power and toughness. Its power (the first number) is how much damage it deals
in combat. Its toughness (the second number) is how much damage must be dealt to it in a single turn to
destroy it. Creatures attack and block during the combat phase.
Unlike other types of permanents, creatures enter the battlefield with “summoning sickness”: a creature
can’t attack, or use an ability that has oT in its cost, until it has started your turn on the battlefield under
your control. You can block with a creature or activate its other abilities no matter how long it’s been on
the battlefield.
Artifact creatures are both artifacts and creatures. They’re usually colorless like other artifacts, and they
can attack and block like other creatures. An artifact creature can be affected by anything that affects
artifacts, as well as anything that affects creatures.</p>

<h3>Planeswalker</h3>
Planeswalkers are powerful allies you can call on to fight by your side. You can cast a planeswalker only at the
time you could cast a sorcery. They’re permanents, and each one enters the battlefield with the number of
loyalty counters indicated in its lower right corner.
Each planeswalker has loyalty abilities that are activated by adding or removing loyalty counters from the
planeswalker. For example, the symbol ! means “Put one loyalty counter on this planeswalker” and the symbol
3 means “Remove three loyalty counters from this planeswalker.” You can activate one of these abilities only
at the time you could cast a sorcery and only if none of that planeswalker’s loyalty abilities have been activated
yet that turn.
Your planeswalkers can be attacked by your opponent’s creatures (if so, you can block as normal), and
your opponents can damage them with their spells and abilities instead of damaging you. Any damage dealt
to a planeswalker causes it to lose that many loyalty counters. If a planeswalker has no loyalty counters, it’s
put into your graveyard.
<h3>Land</h3>
Although lands are permanents, they aren’t cast as spells. To play a land, just put it onto the battlefield. This
happens immediately, so no player can do anything else in response. You can play a land only during one
of your main phases while the stack is empty. You can’t play more than one land a turn.
Most lands have abilities that make mana. You’ll use lands to make the mana you need to pay for spells
and abilities.
Each basic land has a mana ability that makes one mana of a particular color. Plains make white mana
(oW), Islands make blue mana (oU), Swamps make black mana (oB), Mountains make red mana (oR), and
Forests make green mana (oG). Any land other than these five is a nonbasic land.</p>

<center><h1>Game Zones</h1></center>
<p><h3>Library</h3>
When the game begins, your deck of cards becomes your library (your draw
pile). It’s kept face down, and the cards stay in the order they were in at the
beginning of the game. No one can look at the cards in your library, but you
can know how many cards are in each player’s library. Each player has his or
her own library.
<h3>Hand</h3>
When you draw cards, they go to your hand, just as in most other card games.
No one except you can look at the cards in your hand. You start the game with
seven cards in your hand, and you have a maximum hand size of seven. (You
may have more than seven cards in your hand, but you must discard down to
seven at the end of each of your turns.) Each player has his or her own hand.
<h3>The Stack</h3>
Spells and abilities exist on the stack. They wait there to resolve until both
players choose not to cast any new spells or activate any new abilities. Then the
last spell or ability that was put onto the stack resolves, and players get a chance
to cast spells and activate abilities again. (You’ll learn more about casting spells
and activating abilities in the next section.) This zone is shared by both players.
<h3>Battlefield</h3>
You start the game with nothing on the battlefield, but this is where the action
is going to be. On each of your turns, you can play a land from your hand.
Creatures, artifacts, enchantments, and planeswalkers also enter the battlefield
after they resolve. You can arrange your permanents however you want (we
recommend putting lands closest to you), but your opponent must be able to see
all of them and tell whether they’re tapped. This zone is shared by both players.
<h3>Graveyard</h3>
Your graveyard is your discard pile. Your instant and sorcery spells go to your
graveyard when they resolve. Your cards go to your graveyard if an effect causes
them to be discarded, destroyed, sacrificed, or countered. Your planeswalkers go
to your graveyard if they lose all their loyalty counters. Your creatures go to
your graveyard if the damage they’re dealt in a single turn is equal to or greater
than their toughness, or if their toughness is reduced to 0 or less. Cards in your
graveyard are always face up and anyone can look at them at any time. Each
player has his or her own graveyard.
<h3>Exile</h3>
If a spell or ability exiles a card, that card is put in a game area that’s set apart
from the rest of the game. The card will remain there forever, unless whatever
put it there is able to bring it back. Exiled cards are normally face up. This zone
is shared by both players.

<h3>Tapping</h3>
To tap a card is to turn it sideways. You do this when you use a land to make mana,
when you attack with a creature, or when you activate an ability that has the oT
symbol as part of its cost (oT means “tap this permanent”).
When a permanent is tapped, that usually means it’s been used for the turn. You
can’t tap it again until it’s been untapped (straightened out).
At the beginning of each of your turns, you untap your tapped cards so you can
use them again.

<h3>Keywords</h3>
Some permanents have abilities that are shortened to a single word or phrase. Many of these have
reminder text that gives you a brief description of the ability’s effect. Keyword abilities in the core set
include deathtouch, defender, enchant, equip, first strike, flash, flying, haste, hexproof, indestructible,
landwalk (such as swampwalk or forestwalk), lifelink, protection, reach, trample, and vigilance. Most
of these are static abilities, but keyword abilities can also be triggered abilities or activated abilities.
Detailed explanations of each of these abilities can be found in the glossary at the end of this rulebook.
<center><h1>Parts of the Turn</h1></center>
<h3>1. Beginning Phase</h3>
a. Untap step
You untap all your tapped permanents. On the first turn of the
game, you don’t have any permanents, so you just skip this step. No
one can cast spells or activate abilities during this step.
b. Upkeep step
This part of the turn is mentioned on a number of cards. If
something is supposed to happen just once per turn, right at the
beginning, an ability will trigger “at the beginning of your upkeep.”
Players can cast instants and activate abilities.
c. Draw step
You draw a card from your library. (The player who goes first skips
the draw step on his or her first turn to make up for the advantage
of going first.) Players can then cast instants and activate abilities.

<h3>2. Main Phase</h3>
You can cast any number of sorceries, instants, creatures, artifacts,
enchantments, and planeswalkers, and you can activate abilities.
You can play a land during this phase, but remember that you
can play only one land during your turn. Your opponent can cast
instants and activate abilities.

<h3>3. Combat Phase</h3>

<h4>a. Beginning of combat step</h4>
Players can cast instants and activate abilities. This is your
opponent’s last chance to cast spells or activate abilities that stop
your creatures from attacking.

<h4>b. Declare attackers step</h4>
You decide which, if any, of your untapped creatures will attack
and which player or planeswalker they will attack. Then they do
so. This taps the attacking creatures. Players can then cast instants
and activate abilities.
<h4>c. Declare blockers step</h4>
Your opponent decides which, if any, of his or her untapped creatures 
will block your attacking creatures, then they do so. If multiple
creatures block a single attacker, you order the blockers to show
which is first in line for damage, which is second, and so on. Players
can then cast instants and activate abilities.
<h4>d. Combat damage step</h4>
Each attacking or blocking creature that’s still on the battlefield
assigns its combat damage to the defending player (if it’s attacking
that player and wasn’t blocked), to a planeswalker (if it’s attacking
that planeswalker and wasn’t blocked), to the creature or creatures
blocking it, or to the creature it’s blocking. If an attacking creature is
blocked by multiple creatures, you divide its combat damage among
them by assigning at least enough damage to the first blocking
creature in line to destroy it before assigning damage to the next
one in line, and so on. Once players decide how the creatures they
control will deal their combat damage, the damage is all dealt at the
same time. Players can then cast instants and activate abilities.
e. End of combat step
Players can cast instants and activate abilities.

<h3>4. Main Phase</h3>
Your second main phase is just like your first main phase. You can
cast every type of spell and activate abilities, but your opponent can
only cast instants and activate abilities. You can play a land during this
phase if you didn’t during your first main phase.

<h3>5. Ending Phase</h3>
a. End step
Abilities that trigger “at the beginning of your end step” go on the
stack. Players can then cast instants and activate abilities.
b. Cleanup step
If you have more than seven cards in your hand, choose and discard
cards until you have only seven. Next, all damage on creatures is
removed and all “until end of turn” and “this turn” effects end. No
one can cast instants or activate abilities unless an ability triggers
during this step.

<center><h3>Multiplayer Variants/deck types</h3></center>
<h3>Two-Headed Giant</h3>
In a Two-Headed Giant game, you and a teammate play against
another two-person team. You and your teammate can show each
other your hands and discuss strategy. Your team has a shared life
total that starts at 30, you and your teammate have a shared turn,
and your team’s creatures attack the other team as a group. But you
continue to have your own individual library, control your own
permanents, spend your own mana, and so on.

<h3>Planechase</h3>
The Planechase variant adds a deck of oversized plane cards that
set the location for your multiplayer battles across the Multiverse.
The planes have abilities that alter the rules of the game. If you
don’t like your current surroundings, you can try to planeswalk by
rolling the planar die, but be prepared for the occasional chaotic
result!

<>h3Commander</h3>
In a Commander game, each player’s deck is led by the legendary
creature of his or her choice—fittingly, that’s the deck’s commander.
The rest of the deck is a specially crafted arsenal of creatures,
artifacts, and other spells, designed to reflect the personality of
that commander and take advantage of his or her strengths. A
Commander game is best enjoyed as a Free-for-All game among
3–6 players, although two-player games are also common.
Find out more about this grassroots, player-built format at
MTGCommander.net.

<h3>Archenemy</h3>
In an Archenemy game, one player starts with 40 life and an
extra deck of oversized scheme cards. That player is known as the
archenemy. The other players play as a team and try to defeat the
archenemy

<center><h3>tips</h3></center>
In a multiplayer game, the first time a player takes a mulligan, he or she draws a new hand
of seven cards rather than six cards. Subsequent hands decrease by one card as normal.
In a Two-Headed Giant game, the team who plays first skips the draw step of their first
turn. In all other multiplayer games, no player skips the draw step of his or her first turn.
